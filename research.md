[**Upstream Quantity Discounts and Double Marginalization in the New York Liquor Market**](/pdfs/Liquor_Quantity_Discounts.pdf)

This paper exploits a unique data set of price schedules to provide the ﬁrst empirical estimate of the welfare impact of second degree price discrimination in an intermediate goods market. Theoretical welfare predictions in such a context are ambiguous and depend on retailer pass through of input cost discounts to consumers and the distribution of retailer purchase size. I estimate a structural model of the New York retail liquor market where wholesalers oﬀer a multi-part nonlinear tariﬀ for each product. I ﬁnd that banning quantity discounts reduces total welfare by approximately 13% on average.
